### Easily compile Lua code (created with functionality with LuaU)
----
Edit the **Script.lua** file in the main folder with your Lua code, and run main.lua. That's it! Compiled Lua is output to **bytecode.txt**.



----
**IMPORTANT:** The script that is compiled is **not** interpreted, to interpret (execute/run) the compiled bytecode use an interpreter such as FiOne:
